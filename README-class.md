# Project1
<h2>Project 1:</h2>
Due 4.16.2017 by 11:59pm through GitHub Classroom 
Projects may be submitted up to 3 days late, with a 10% penalty per day.

<h2>Overview: </h2>
You've been provided consumer data by Zayo. They simply want to understand what's going on in all of this data! Your goal is to create a series of interactive visualizations that can be used to explore different aspects of this data.

This repository contains five datasets that reflect a subset of this data. You will use a combination of these datasets to build these tools. All code created as part of this project will remain yours to share as you see fit. None will be provided to Zayo without your express consent.

<h2>Minimum Requirements:</h2> 
Your project must:
<ul>
<li> Include a README.md file that outlines:
  <ul>
  <li>Information about your visualizations and what they show. Include information about interactions as appropriate.</li>
  <li>Your design process (e.g., how did you go about designing, building, and refining your system? Why did you choose these representations?)</li>
  <li>Your team roles for each individual</li>
  <li>How to run your project</li></ul></li>
<li>Include at least three unique visualizations:
  <ul>
  <li>One visualization must be spatial (e.g., a map or plot that leverages geospatial information in some way)</li>
  <li>One visualization must be non-spatial (e.g., a timeline, histogram, etc.)</li>
  <li>Each visualization must be interactive</li>
  <li>Your set of three visualizations should contain at least one data attribute from two different sheets</li>
  <li>Your set of three visualizations should visualize at least five data attributes total</li></ul></li>
<li>Be able to work with any dataset of this format (e.g., the numbers are interchangable but the columns and document titles are fixed).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Above and Beyond:</h2> 
The above requirements are the minimum for a passing grade on this project. Some ideas to improve your project include:<ul>
  <li>Dashboarding: Show all three visualizations as part of the same screen.</li>
<li>Added Visualizations: Provide more than three visualizations</li>
<li>Dynamic Queries: Including UI widgets that allow you to change the current data field</li>
<li>Missing Data: Not all rows have data for all columns. Design ways of handling missing data intelligently.</li>
<li>Coordinated Views: Have two or more visualizations that interact with one another as you move through the data.</li>
<li>Overview+Detail: Provide a pair of views that allow viewers to retain context as they navigate your data.</li>
<li>Style: Keep the style consistent across all your views, with an eye towards intelligently applying visual design.</li></ul>

<h2>Platforms:</h2> 
You can use any development platform you'd like so long as it is not proprietary (exception: MatLab as we have a University License). Please do not use WYSIWYG tools for your final submission (you're welcome to do so for prototyping). Your project readme should include step-by-step instructions on how to run your projects and it should run without me having to modify the code. You are welcome to use different platforms for each visualization.

Some platforms to look at include:
<ul>
<li>D3</li>
<li>R with ggplot</li>
<li>WebGL or Three.js</li>
<li>Processing or ProcessingJS</li>
<li>Google Maps API</li>
<li>Open Street Map API</li>
</ul>

<h2>Submissions:</h2>
All submissions must be made through GitHub with a timestamp by 11:59pm on 4.14. Your submission files should include:
<ul>
<li>Your README</li>
<li>Your code</li>
</ul>

Each member of the team should also send me a project post-mortem through email documenting the following:
* What you worked on in the project
* What your teammates worked on in the project
* How you would rate your performance and why
* How you would rate each teammates' performance and why

These documents will be kept confidential and will factor into project grades. If you feel all of the team worked hard and performed well, please don't hesitate to tell me that (no curving is necessary on performance reviews :-))! Also, please keep in mind that different team members have different skillsets, roles, and experiences.

<h2>Grading: </h2>
The project will be scored out of 100 points total. Your project will be graded on four different criteria:
<ol>
<li> Creativity</li>
<li> Technical execution</li>
<li> Design (both aesthetic and your visualization choices)</li>
<li> Project Post-Mortems</li>
</ol>
